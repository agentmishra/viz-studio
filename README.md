# Visualization Studio

Built on top of p5.js, a code-based live animation editor. Freely modify animation code without restarting the animation, or pause and seek to modify and view the animation at a specific moment in time.

Any modifications will be serialized and written to the URL which can be copied and shared.

Example Animations:

[Parametric Equation based on animation time](https://viz.intelligence.rocks/)

[Double Pendulum](https://viz.intelligence.rocks/#pendulum)

[Mandelbrot](https://viz.intelligence.rocks/#mandelbrot)
